    </p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>â…“ cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>5 large egg whites</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>6 slices bread</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine half-and-half, egg whites, confectioners' sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, 
                lemon extract, and salt in a bowl; whip together with a whisk or electric whisk 
                until well blended, about 30 seconds. Pour mixture into a large, flat container</li>
            <li>Put one bread slice in the container and flip so it is coated on both sides, 
                almost saturated.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a frying pan over medium heat until sizzling. 
                Add soaked bread slice to the pan; you can do more than one depending on the size 
                of the pan. Fry until medium brown and edges are crispy, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.
                 Continue cooking in batches, dipping bread and frying, and adding butter</li>
            <li>Serve French toast with maple syrup and add whipped cream on top</li>
        </ol>
